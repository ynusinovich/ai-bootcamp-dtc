It inhabits savannas and dense forests near water bodies, living in social groups of 10-20 individuals, sometimes up to 100. Capybaras are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and aquatic plants, and are known for their excellent swimming abilities. They communicate through various vocalizations and have a unique social structure, with dominant males protecting females. While not currently threatened, they face hunting pressures in some regions. Capybaras have adapted well to urban environments and are often found in zoos.

While the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is not currently classified as threatened, it experiences hunting pressures in certain regions, particularly for its meat, which is consumed in various cultures, especially during Lent in Venezuela. Additionally, habitat destruction due to agricultural expansion and urban development poses significant risks to their natural environments. The Lesser Capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius) is classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN, indicating insufficient data on its population status, which may also reflect underlying threats to its survival. Overall, while capybaras have adapted well to some urban environments, ongoing threats from hunting and habitat degradation remain critical concerns for their populations.' sources=['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerus', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara']\n",

      "  \"summary\": \"The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest rodent species, native to South America. It inhabits savannas and dense forests near water bodies, living in social groups of 10-20 individuals, sometimes up to 100. Capybaras are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and aquatic plants, and are known for their excellent swimming abilities. They communicate through various vocalizations and have a unique social structure, with dominant males protecting females. While not currently threatened, they face hunting pressures in some regions. Capybaras have adapted well to urban environments and are often found in zoos. Their meat is consumed in some cultures, particularly during Lent in Venezuela.\",\n",

Related to modern capybaras, fossils of Caviodon have been discovered in Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil. This genus contributes to the understanding of rodent evolution in South America, particularly in relation to the Hydrochoerinae subfamily. The study of Caviodon helps paleontologists understand the diversity and adaptations of prehistoric rodents in various environments, shedding light on their ecological roles during their time. Fossils indicate that these rodents thrived in diverse habitats.\",\n",

Capybaras are semi-aquatic and inhabit regions near lakes, rivers, and swamps in South America. They are social animals, often living in groups of up to 100, and communicate through various vocalizations. Their diet primarily consists of grasses, and they have a gestation period of 130-150 days, typically giving birth to two to eight young. The genus includes two extant species: the common capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius).\",\n",
