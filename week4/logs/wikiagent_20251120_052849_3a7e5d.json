The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as one hundred individuals, but usually live in groups of 10\u201320 individuals.

They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.<ref name=\"Barreto 1998\"/> Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.<ref name=\"Quintana 1998\"/> The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.<ref name=\"SFZoo\"/> Capybaras are [[coprophagous|autocoprophagous]],<ref name=\"taronga-zoo\"/> meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial [[gut flora]], to help digest the [[cellulose]] in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food.

While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10\u201320 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> They can make dog-like barks<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> when threatened or when females are herding young.<ref name=\"Murphey 1985\"/>\n\nCapybaras have two types of [[scent gland]]s: a morrillo, located on the snout, and [[anal gland]]s. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1984\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|left|Mother with typical litter of about four pups]]\nWhen in [[estrus]], the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (''Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris'')|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\"/> The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.<ref name=r1/> Capybara [[gestation]] is 130\u2013150 days, and produces a litter of four young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter.<ref name=r4/> Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle\u2014from any female in the group\u2014until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group.<ref name=\"Bristol\"/> [[Alloparenting]] has been observed in this species.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil.<ref name=r4/>\n\n===Activities===\nThough quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water.

They were first observed in Pacific river valleys in Panama as early as 1912 as a subspecies of the common capybara. However, after thorough studies on the anatomy and genealogy of them, the lesser capybara was classified as its own species some time in the 1980s.{{cn|date=February 2025}} Currently, this species has expanded its range to parts of Eastern Panama and Western Colombia and Venezuela, just west of the Andes Mountains. The lesser capybara constitutes the northernmost population of any extant capybara species,<ref name=\":0\" /> other than the now [[Extinction|extinct]] [[Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites|''H. hesperotiganites'']] from [[Pleistocene]] [[California]].\n\n== Diet ==\nLesser capybaras are herbivores that mainly graze on grasses and other aquatic plants. However, during dry seasons when their main source of food is depleted, the lesser capybaras will tend to feed on reeds, grains, melons, and squash. On average, an adult will eat {{convert|6|to|8|lb|kg}} of this food per day. Although not a main part of their diet, lesser capybaras will also eventually [[Coprophagia|ingest their own feces]] to gain bacteria that benefits them in breaking down thick fibers eaten.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |last=Schmidt |first=Amanda |date=2023-08-14 |title=Capybara Fact Sheet {{!}} Blog {{!}} Nature |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/blog/capybara-fact-sheet/ |access-date=2024-10-21 |website=Nature |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Physical description ==\nJust like greater capybaras, the lesser capybara is characterized by short, brown hair, with blunt snouts, four short legs (front legs are smaller than hind), partially webbed feet, small eyes and ears situated high on their head, and a very tiny tail.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |date=2024-09-28 |title=Capybara {{!}} Description, Behavior, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/capybara-genus#ref756135 |access-date=2024-11-10 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> Compared to greater capybaras, the lesser capybara is generally smaller in size, with adults growing up to {{convert|3|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} in length, weighing up to {{convert|62|lb|kg}}, and having a darker brown coat.{{cn|date=February 2025}}\n[[File:Hydrochoerus_isthmius_46666145.jpg|thumb|Lesser capybara up close]]\n\n== Adaptations ==\nAs animals that are considered prey for many animals, the species is very wary of predators and likes to travel in groups of about 20 cavies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/capybara-life-cycle-mating-reproduction.html |title=Capybara Definition, Lifespan & Reproduction |access-date=2024-11-10 |website=study.com}}</ref> As a result, the capybaras have adapted to be excellent swimmers and dive regularly in water to avoid predators such as jaguars and anacondas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Having eyes and ears placed high on their heads, the capybaras can see these predators while in the waters.
